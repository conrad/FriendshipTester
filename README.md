Do you remember your friends?

This game tests whether you can type in the correct name for your friends on Facebook after only seeing their profile picture.

It shows you 20 friends by default. If you can get more than 5 right, you're doing better than most of the people we've tested this on.

Unfortunately this currently only works locally due to some issues with Facebook's new API. It requires Mongo. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmconrad/airfare-faces faces && cd faces
npm install
npm start

```

The game should then run on localhost:3000. Try it and challenge your "friends" :)
